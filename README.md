  # 🌱 vegetation biomass-Soil water-herbivore model

This repository contains two primary components:
1. Python scripts for the direct numerical simulation of the vegetation–soil water–herbivore model (pydns).
2. MATLAB scripts for performing numerical continuation and constructing the corresponding bifurcation diagram (bwhcont).
A comprehensive reference sheet is included, providing detailed descriptions of all files, along with instructions for executing the simulations and generating the results.
