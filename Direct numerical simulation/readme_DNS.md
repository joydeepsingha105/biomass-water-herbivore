# üå± vegetation biomass-Soil water-herbivore model ‚Äî Direct Numerical simuulation (DNS) Implementation

This repository contains the `py-pde` implementation of a vegetation-soil water-herbivore model. It enables the direct numerical simulation of the model for a given initial condition in one and two dimensional domains. A separate jupyter notebook containing script for post precessing in pyplot is also given. The user is encourged to read the reference sheet for brief explanation of the codes.
